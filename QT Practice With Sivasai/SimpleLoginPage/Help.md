# Simple Login Page Example

This project demonstrates a basic login page implemented using Qt, with static username and password credentials.

## Features

### User Interface

- Designed a straightforward login form with fields for username and password.
- Includes a login button for authentication and an area for displaying error messages.

### Functionality

- Utilizes static credentials (`username: root`, `password: root`) for simplicity.
- Validates user input upon clicking the login button:
  - Displays a success message and navigates to a simulated home page upon successful login.
  - Shows an error message if the entered credentials are incorrect, allowing the user to retry.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Qt development environment.
3. Build and run the application to see the login page in action.
4. Enter `admin` as the username and `password` as the password to experience a successful login.

## Notes

- This project serves as a basic example and can be expanded upon for more complex authentication needs.
- Adjust the static credentials or integrate with a database for real-world scenarios.
